                Mortimer: First Launch is a 3D adventure puzzle/stealth game created using the Unity Engine (v2022.3.43f1 LTS). In the game, users take control of the titular character, Mortimer, and guide him on his journey to build a rocket and reach the moon so that he can eat the cheese he believes it is made of. Users must navigate the environment, avoid humans, utilize stealth and solve puzzles to achieve the goals of collecting rocket parts and blasting off to the stars. The game takes place in a fictionalized version of Hatbill Park in Florida, near the Kennedy Space Center, and is presented in a third-person, over the shoulder camera perspective which makes use of toon shading for the visuals. <br /><br />

                It was made by a team of five student developers, including myself, over the course of three months as a part of the Ticorporate Demo Lab course at Jyvaskyla University of Applied Sciences. The idea behind Ticorporate Demo Lab is that we would first come up with ideas, then pitch them in pairs with the six best projects being selected by peer voting. Once the projects had been selected, it was then up to the winning pairs to form groups of five to seven developers around which they would create a mock company for the development of the game. There were two layers to the process, the first and most obvious being the development aspect where the team would focus on the product, what it is, what it needed to be, and how they would achieve their goals. The other aspect was organizing the development team into an AGILE structure, with a Product Owner (PO), Scrum Master (SM), and Producer handling the administrative tasks as well as the scrum and sprint cycles. Additional admin roles were Business, Marketing, and Publishing.

            <p>
                For the duration of this project, I served as Product Owner of our team as we attempted to employ AGILE processes, overseeing the project from concept to completion. I was responsible for the creation of the project's vision, the development of the project's roadmap, and the prioritization of the project's backlog. The project backlog was created and maintained using our own private company Github Organization, where we made extensive use of the Github Projects board to track the progress of the project. As mentioned before, the project was developed using AGILE methodologies, with our team's 'sprints lasting two weeks each and bookended by sprint planning and sprint review. <br /><br />

                I created the Github Organization and set up the project board, and was responsible for maintaining the project's vision and roadmap throughout the development process. Individual developers on the team were responsible for creating and maintaining their own tasks on the project board from the backlog items, and I was responsible for ensuring that the project board was up-to-date and that the project was on track to meet its goals.

            <p> Apart from my administrative role, I also served as both Technical Artist and Visual Effects Artist for the project. My responsibilities for the development of the project were as follows:</p><br />
            <h2>Shader and Material Creation</h2>
            <img src="images/portfolio/shadergraphsample.png" alt="Shader Creation Placeholder" class="section-image" />
            <p>
                During production of Mortimer: First Launch, I developed four custom shaders using Unity's Shader Graph to meet with the needs of our game. These custom shader graphs included an outline shader, a fresnel glow shader for highlighting objects, a custom shader using flipbook logic to allow for human NPCs with different clothing, and an object shine shader for highlighting interactable objects. These shader graphs were created to be lightweight and optimized for performance.
            </p>

            <h3>Water Shader</h3>
            <video class="section-video" autoplay loop muted>
                <source src="images/portfolio/WaterShader.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
            <p>The water shader selected for use in the game is a modified version of <a href="https://staggart.xyz/">Staggart Creations</a>' <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/stylized-water-2-170386">Stylized Water 2</a> shader asset. This asset is highly customizable, comes with a host of built-in features and also supports third party integrations with several other popular ready made assets. (See documentation <a href="https://staggart.xyz/unity/stylized-water-2/sws-2-docs/?section=stylized-water-2">here</a>)</p>

            <p>Using this asset as a base, I set up a material that would mimick swampy water and then worked through several iterations of art style, visuals and overall design for the look of the water. This process was aided by gathering feedback from my team members as well as getting impressions from individuals outside of the project. The water in our project was further enhanced by adding on functionality for enhanced dynamic effects - underwater rendering, normal displacement for simulating waves and ripples, and splash functionality which would respond to the character or objects dropped into the water, passing the information into the GPU buffer to be read by the shader for further normal displacement and realism.</p>

            <h3>Outline Shader</h3>
            <img src="images/portfolio/outlineshader.png" alt="Outline Shader" class="section-image" />
            <p>I created a simple, lightweight outline shader using Shader Graph. There was a desire for the powerlines which extend between utility poles at one of the campgrounds to have the same outlined look that trees and other objects do, but as the powerlines have movement built into them with a shader I needed to create an additional material layer to add on top of it, this shader is the result of that work. It works by using the Normal Vector in object space, normalizing it, and scaling it by a controllable Outline Thickness value. This scaled vector is added to the object's position to create the outline offset. The outline is rendered in the Fragment stage, with a customizable Outline Color and thickness, likely using a back-face culling trick to ensure the outline is visible around the object.</p>

            <h3>Fresnel Glow Shader</h3>
            <img src="images/portfolio/fresnelglowshader.png" alt="Fresnel Glow Shader" class="section-image" />
            <p>A simple fresnel effect shader I made on request to solve an issue with key items in the world not being noticeable enough. We ended up going with a different solution for that particular problem, outlined below in the Object Shine shader, but the shader was kept in the project for potential future use. The shader works by calculating the dot product of the Normal Vector and the View Direction, raising it to a Power value to control the sharpness of the effect. This result is multiplied by a selectable Fresnel Color which is added to the base color in the fragment stage. The shader outputs a glow-like appearance around the edges of the object, with control over intensity and color through the exposed properties.</p>

            <h3>Human Flipbook Shader</h3>
            <img src="images/portfolio/humanflipbookshader.png" alt="Human Flipbook Shader" class="section-image" />
            <p>The human NPCs in <strong>Mortimer</strong> went through several iterations in terms of look and feel. The initial concept was to make them appear strange, frightening and almost monstrous as they might be interpreted by a Raccoon's eye. This concept was later scrapped as it wasn't working how we wanted it to. Our Lead Programmer came up with a flipbook node structure through which a selection of textures could be randomly assigned via scripting upon NPC instantiation, allowing for different looks for the characters while still appearing strange. This iteration was better, but still not quite what we wanted. My solution took our programmer's flipbook structure and added the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Toon Shading:</strong> Added a color ramp for simplified lighting bands, giving the characters a stylized cartoon look.</li>
                <li><strong>Fresnel Glow:</strong> Implemented edge highlighting to emphasize character silhouettes and increase their separation from the background.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Flipbook Textures:</strong> Enhanced the existing flipbook structure to cycle through pre-baked textures, allowing for unique appearances per NPC while retaining their strange, otherworldly style.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In the end, this re-worked shader allowed for 16 options for each category (Skin, Shirt, Pants and Shoes), allowing for 65,536 unique combinations of humans which can exist with roughly a 3.7% chance of 2 NPCs in 100 instantiating using the same exact look.</p>

            <h3>Object Shine Shader</h3>
            <img src="images/portfolio/objectshineshader.png" alt="Object Shine Shader" class="section-image" />

            <p>This shader was our team's chosen solution for highlighting interactable objects during the tutorial and regular gameplay sections. It adds a dynamic, animated, emissive shine effect to objects by scrolling a supplied texture across an objects vertices.  </p>
            <p>The features of the shader are as follows: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>UV Remapping:</strong> The UV coordinates are split, flipped, and recombined to enable directional movement of the shine effect.</li>
                <li><strong>Scrolling Animation:</strong> Shine speed and direction are controlled by a scrolling UV animation tied to customizable time parameters.</li>
                <li><strong>Emissive Power:</strong> A power multiplier adjusts the brightness and intensity of the shine, blending seamlessly with the object's base texture.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Control:</strong> Boolean properties allow toggling the shine effect on or off and adjusting its parameters dynamically via scripts.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A brief explanation of how it works:</p>

            <ol>
                <li> The UV Coordinates define how a texture is wrapped around an object's vertices. </li>
                <li> Through altering these coordinates the texture appears to move across the surface even though the object itself remains static. </li>
                <li> For the scrolling mechanic the shader uses a Time node to create a continuously changing value. The value of the time node is multiplied by a speed factor and added to the UV coordinates. </li>
                <li> The updated UV coordinates then shift the sampled texture over the object's vertices, giving the appearance of motion.</li>

            </ol>


            <h3>Materials</h3>
            <img src="images/portfolio/materialsexample.png" alt="Materials Example" class="section-image" />
            <p>In addition to the custom shaders, I created and maintained a library of materials based off of the <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/quibli-anime-shaders-and-tools-203178">Quibli: Anime Shaders and Tools</a> asset pack. In total 112 materials were created for use in the game (89 used for vegetation objects, 23 used for various other objects placed in the game world.) Quibli was chosen as the style best represented what our team agreed was the look we wanted for the project. From the baseline offering I trialed several different custom settings options before the final look for <strong>Mortimer: First Launch</strong> was approved by our Art Lead.</p>
            <img src="images/portfolio/quibliexample.png" alt="Quibli Settings Example" class="section-image-small" />
            <p>The end result was a hand-drawn, cartoon look with a hint of anime influence via flat shading and clearly defined outlines for the edges of static objects, while objects in motion such as leaves, grass and smaller ground vegetation retained the flat shading but abandoned the outline in favor of blending in with their surroundings. A key consideration was ensuring that the materials and settings used would respond well to shadows and the specific lighting used in the scenes, this required several iterations in order to get it right.</p>
            <img src="images/portfolio/materialcloseup.png" alt="Material Close Up" class="section-image" />
            <p>Above is a closer look of the materials in game.</p>

            <h2>Real-Time Visual Effects</h2>
            <img src="images/portfolio/vfxgraph.png" alt="VFX Graph" class="section-image" />
            <p>
                In <strong>Mortimer: First Launch</strong>, I created a total of 10 distinct visual effects using Unity's VFX Graph and Particle System. These effects were carefully designed to enhance the game's whimsical tone while maintaining visual consistency. Four of the effects were built using VFX Graph for high-impact, dynamic visuals, while six utilized the Particle System for more straightforward yet effective animations.
            </p>
            <h3>VFX Graph Effects</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Campfire</strong>: A dynamic, flickering fire effect paired with a heat distortion shader. Additional to the fire are a rising smoke effect, and dynamic comic book "crackle" and "pop" text particles.</li>
                <li><strong>Guiding Wind</strong>: A tailed particle effect which instantiates from food items, winding their way toward Mortimer. This serves as a directional guide for players.</li>
                <li><strong>Rockets and Moons</strong>: An effect where 3D mesh particles resembling rockets and moons orbit Mortimer's head in a field of stars after he loses a life and respawns. Inspired by classic Looney Tunes visuals.</li>
                <li><strong>Stylized Rocket Smoke</strong>: A highly stylized VFX graph used during the Space Shuttle launch sequence in the tutorial. The effect simulates cartoonish smoke trails, creating an engaging and memorable cinematic moment.</li>
            </ul>

            </video> <br />
            <h3>Particle System Effects</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bonfire Smoke</strong>: A complementary, long-distance visible rising smoke effect to aid in navigation towards landmarks and points of interest.</li>
                <li><strong>Conveyor Belt Smoke</strong>: Puffs of cartoon style smoke emitted from the end of a conveyor belt after Mortimer activates it, giving life to static objects.</li>
                <li><strong>Landing Smoke</strong>: A burst of cartoon-style smoke triggered when Mortimer lands from a significant height, adding feedback to his movement.</li>
                <li><strong>Mortimer Eating</strong>: A chaotic, comic-book-inspired effect featuring clouds of smoke, shooting lines, colorful debris, and animated "nom nom nom" text. This hides object swaps and enhances Mortimer's eating animations.</li>
                <li><strong>Soda Bottle Drop</strong>: A smoke puff which occurs when Mortimer drops a bag of soda bottles off a conveyor belt, reinforcing cause-and-effect mechanics.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Splash</strong>: A cartoon style splash effect with ripples at impact points, triggered when Mortimer jumps or falls into water.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Lighting and Post-Processing</h2>
            <img src="images/portfolio/lightingandpostprocessing.png" alt="Lighting and Post Processing" class="section-image" />
            <p>
                I designed the lighting to mimic a summer sunset. Using a directional light positioned as the sun setting  in the west (negative X rotation), I shifted the color palette towards more soft pastel tones of orange and pink. This approach ensured the lighting felt natural and believable while complementing the vibrant colors in the scene without overwhelming them. Shadows were carefully adjusted to balance the moody sunset aesthetic with the practical need for visibility, further offset by a secondary directional light set to low intensity pointed in opposition to the main directional light, to fake light reflection from the surface onto the underside of vegetation.
            </p>
            <p>
                For performance and flexibility, I opted for dynamic, real-time lighting instead of baked lighting. This decision reduced the need for time-consuming GPU lightmap bakes during development and allowed for potential future implementation of a day/night cycle without additional rework.
            </p>
            <p>
                Post-processing was implemented through a global volume, the following effects were applied:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bloom</strong>: To create a subtle glow around brighter areas and emphasize highlights.</li>
                <li><strong>Tonemapping</strong>: For adjusting the overall tone and dynamic range of the scene.</li>
                <li><strong>Film Grain</strong>: To add texture and a cinematic feel to the visuals.</li>
                <li><strong>Lift, Gamma, Gain</strong>: For precise control over brightness and contrast in different tonal ranges.</li>
                <li><strong>Shadows, Midtones, Highlights</strong>: To fine-tune color balance and contrast across specific tonal areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Channel Mixer</strong>: For advanced color adjustments and balancing.</li>
                <li><strong>Color Grading</strong>: To harmonize the overall color palette and enhance the sunset-inspired aesthetic.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Environmental Creation</h2>
            <img src="images/portfolio/environmentalcreation.png" alt="Environment Creation" class="section-image" />
            <p>
                The primary focus of the environmental design in <strong>Mortimer: First Launch</strong> was to establish a sense of believable realism. The goal was to create an environment that felt authentic enough for those familiar with the real Hatbill Park in Florida to recognize specific sections of the waterways, even with the limitations of vegetation detail and the addition of fantastical elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                I created the terrain using a modified satellite image of the Hatbill Park area provided by our lead designer. This terrain included waterways, three campgrounds, and a small township named Utopia, situated in the northwest corner. Using the satellite image as a guide, I traced the waterways with Unity's terrain tools to establish the basic structure. Feedback led to the addition of a hill within Hatbill Park, designed as a viewpoint and landmark for player navigation.
            </p>
            <img src="images/portfolio/maplayoutimage.png" alt="Map Layout Created by Team Design Lead" class="section-image-small" />
            <br /> <br />
            <p>
                The workflow relied on importing the designer's image and transforming it into a semi-transparent material applied to a plane. This served as a tracing paper overlay, scaled to match the terrain at a 1:1 ratio. Unity's Terrain Tools asset pack was used for sculpting, smoothing, and refining the terrain. Vegetation was placed using <a href="https://staggart.xyz/">Staggart Creations</a>' Vegetation Spawner, while <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/procedural-terrain-painter-188357">Terrain Painter</a> by Staggart Creations was used to create detailed terrain texture layers. Grass was generated using <a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/minionsart/posts">Minions Art</a>'s Computer Shader grass tool as a baseline, with the bulk of the effort spent on ensuring a visually consistent environment.

            <p>
                My work on <strong>Mortimer: First Launch</strong> involved extensive optimization and technical art responsibilities to ensure the game maintained a balance between visual fidelity and performance. I focused heavily on baking and refining occlusion culling maps, modifying Levels of Detail (LoDs) to achieve optimal rendering, and adjusting the number of vegetation items spawned in the scene to provide high-quality visuals without compromising performance. Additionally, I handled the implementation of all assets, verifying their proper integration into the game world, and reporting bugs to the QA Lead or respective team members when issues arose.

                One major performance challenge occurred after vegetation was fully implemented on the completed terrain, causing significant FPS drops. To address this, I employed what I referred to as a triage based optimization strategy:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Modified LoDs to balance rendering detail with performance.</li>
                <li>Reduced the number of vegetation instances in the terrain while maintaining visual consistency.</li>
                <li>Split the terrain into smaller chunks to be loaded on demand, reducing resource overhead.</li>
                <li>Divided parts of the game world into separate scenes to be loaded additively when needed, improving overall efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                An additional issue arose in the Hatbill Park campground, where severe FPS drops occurred, even when viewed from a distance. After thorough investigation, I discovered that a 3D chain-link and barbed wire fence model created by our Art Lead was the cause. Disabling the barbed wire portion of the model resolved the issue, allowing me to deliver detailed bug reports and findings to the artist. Through collaboration, the model was reworked, and the problem was permanently resolved.
